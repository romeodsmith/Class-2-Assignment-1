    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p class="para">
        My name is Romeo Smith.  I was born in Georgetown, Guyana.  I came to America in 1983.  My family and I settled down in Brooklyn New York where I attended school.  Shortly after graduation, I enlisted into the armed forces and served thirteen years.  I completed my enlistment in 2009 and began a second career in security.  Although I love security and all the disciplines associated with it, I have a hidden passion for real estate. I hope to become a full time real estate investor.  I realized over the years that all occupational disciplines have at least one thing in common.  They all require some understanding of information technology.  Whether it is software, hardward, cyber security or web design.  I realized I can no longer run from the title wave known as IT as it blankets the globe.  Due to the inevidable, I decided to pursue an understanding of web design so I won't be ignorant and to make me more marketable.
